# Handling CSVs

## Importing

[csvtojson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson) is a great Promise-based package for importing CSV data into JavaScript objects.

Using the following sample data (saved as `data.csv`):

```
Name,Favorite Color,Favorite Food
Chris,purple,sushi
Sam,red,
James,green,pizza
```

Inside an `async` function, data can be imported using the following:

```js
const csv = require("csvtojson");
const path = require("path");
...
const data = await csv().fromFile(path.join(__dirname, "data.csv"));
```

which should produce the following in `data`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
[
  {
    Name: "Chris",
    "Favorite Color": "purple",
    "Favorite Food": "sushi"
  },
  {
    Name: "Sam",
    "Favorite Color": "red",
    "Favorite Food": ""
  },
  {
    Name: "James",
    "Favorite Color": "green",
    "Favorite Food": "pizza"
  }
]
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Alternatively, an object can be passed into `csv()` such as `{ output: 'csv' }`, resulting in the following `data`:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
[
  ["Chris", "purple", "sushi"]
  ["Sam", "red", ""]
  ["James", "green", "pizza"]
]
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Exporting

[json2csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv) does the opposite: converts a Javascript object into a CSV string, ready to be written to a file using something like `fs`.

Using the same object as above:

```js
const { parseAsync: parse } = require('json2csv');
const fs = require('fs').promises;
...
const csv_new = await parse(data);
await fs.writeFile('data_new.csv', csv_new);
```

will produce the following CSV (note that strings are automatically wrapped in double quotes):

```
"Name","Favorite Color","Favorite Food"
"Chris","purple","sushi"
"Sam","red",""
"James","green","pizza"
```

json2csv also offers options such as custom [fields](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv#example-fields-option) or [delimiters](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json2csv#example-5).
