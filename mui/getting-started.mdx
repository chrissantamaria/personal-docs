# Getting started

(more in-depth installation instructions can be found [here](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/))

All of the Material-UI docs provided on this site will be based on `@material-ui/core@4.1.0`.

Material-UI can be installed using `yarn add @material-ui/core`. Additionally, you may want to install `@material-ui/icons` (see [Icons](/mui-icons)).

Material-UI was designed to be used with the Roboto font which can be installed by including the following in your `index.html`:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```

Alternatively, Roboto can be [installed using Yarn or NPM](https://material-ui.com/components/typography/#install-with-npm) and included in the root `index.js`.
